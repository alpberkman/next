When implementing the outer interpreter have a mechaism for catching sigkill (Ctrl+C).

Consider adding linenoise or editline or
write your own that can also traverse the 'last'
the lp pointer already points to the variable that holds the last word,
use it to traverse and find the matching words, find the longest matching part
use to array
stub[32] -> what is typed so far
found[32] -> longest matching prefix
if word is immediate make it red?


use cpp for words you dont want in the dictionary
#define on true, strc
#define off false, strc
...

NEST and NEXT colon words are never used
maybe special colon words to push them to the stack
or
when preparing eval
here, NEST, strc
